## Introduction

BMV Inc. is changing the way skilled-trades providers initiate and facilitate their service by reinventing the services marketplace. By empowering clients to film and narrate their needs, which allow service providers to bid remotely and arrive more prepared, we are able to offer cost-effective lead generation in a growing market of high-cost platforms. With use of video, escrow and stepped mediation features, BMV Inc. has created simple ways that allow for confidence and swift action by all users.

**Available for both iOS and Android.**

## Features

A few of the things you can do with BidMyVid¬Æ:

### For Clients

Simply shoot videos saying what you need done as if the contractor was there with you.  Submit the video on the BidMyVid¬Æ platform and bids from service contractors will be available for you to review at your availability.  No more 2-Hour arrival windows and taking time off work if you are a client needing repairs at your home or business.

### For Contractors
It‚Äôs easy to qualify jobs and save time, not to mention come more prepared.  Use BidMyVid¬Æ to save you trips by giving you a wider view of what is needed.  Our platform collects the funds for you so no time is spent collecting after the project is done.  These are just a few of the values of time saving features created.  Made by Contractors for Contractors, we know we are better together!
